This repository contains code for analyzing Instagram engagement metrics using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
Code Overview

Data Preprocessing: The code preprocesses the dataset, checks for missing values, calculates total engagement metrics, and computes the engagement rate.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Seaborn and Plotly Express libraries are used to visualize the distribution of impressions from different sources, analyze user behavior patterns, and explore the relationships between engagement metrics.
Text Analysis: Word clouds are generated to visualize the most frequent words used in Captions and Hashtags.
Machine Learning Modeling: Scikit-learn library is utilized to build a Passive Aggressive Regressor model for predicting Impressions based on engagement metrics.
